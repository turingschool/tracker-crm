## Overview

This app is a Rails backend API for a job tracking CRM tool that allows users to save lists of job applications, companies, and professional contacts under a personal account. The frontend repo that consumes this API lives here: https://github.com/turingschool/tracker-crm-fe. 

This project is the product of the efforts of 35+ Turing students working collaboratively across several graduating classes. A full list of contributors can be found at the bottom of this README, along with a list of licenses. 

## Setup

## ATTENTION ALL CONTRIBUTORS
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Scanning with Brakeman (REQUIRED)
- To maintain a high level of security in this project, all contributors must run [Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org/) prior to submitting a pull request.

#### ‚úÖ How to Run Brakeman
- Before pushing your code or submitting a PR, run the following command in the root of the Rails project:
`brakeman -A -q -o bm-report.md`

- This will generate a security report in a markdown file [bm-report.md](/bm-report.md).

#### üìã Include Brakeman Results in Your PR

After creating your pull request, copy and paste the contents of the [bm-report.md](/bm-report.md) file into your PR description between the following comments:

```
### Brakeman Results (REQUIRED):
<!--- Copy and paste your bm-report.md -->

<!--- Between these two comments -->
```

## Security Warnings
- If Brakeman includes any `security warnings` in the report, please notify the project manager and create a backlog card on the project board to review and research any possible security vulnerabilities.

## Testing

#### This app uses RSpec for testing:
`bundle exec rspec`

###### Models:
`bundle exec rspec /spec/models`

###### Requests:
`bundle exec rspec /spec/requests/api/v1`

###### Gateways:
`bundle exec rspec /spec/gateways`

## Testing with Factorybot
 - This application utilizes FactoryBot to streamline the creation of test data for RSpec. 
 - Factories allow us to generate consistent, reusable test objects without manually setting up database records.

#### FactoryBot Commands w/ Test Files:

`create(:user)` - Autogenerate a user with the "user" role that gets added to the test database and validates with ActiveRecord
`build(:user)` - Autogenerate a user with the "user" role that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

`create(:company)` - Autogenerate a company and user that gets added to the test database and validates with ActiveRecord
`build(:company)` - Autogenerate a company and user that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

`create(:contact)` - Autogenerate a contact, company, and user that gets added to the test database and validates with ActiveRecord.
`build(:contact)` - Autogenerate a contact, company, and user that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

`create(:job_application)` - Autogenerate a job application, company, and user that gets added to the test database and validates with ActiveRecord.
`build(:job_application)` - Autogenerate a job application, company, and user that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

#### FactoryBot Commands w/ Rails Console:
- Launch Rails Console:
`rails console`

`FactoryBot.create(:user)` - Autogenerate a user with the "user" role that gets added to the development database and validates with ActiveRecord
`FactoryBot.build(:user)` - Autogenerate a user with the "user" role that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

`FactoryBot.create(:company)` - Autogenerate a company and user that gets added to the development database and validates with ActiveRecord
`FactoryBot.build(:company)` - Autogenerate a company and user that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

`FactoryBot.create(:contact)` - Autogenerate a contact, company, and user that gets added to the development database and validates with ActiveRecord.
`FactoryBot.build(:contact)` - Autogenerate a contact, company, and user that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

`FactoryBot.create(:job_application)` - Autogenerate a job application, company, and user that gets added to the development database and validates with ActiveRecord.
`FactoryBot.build(:job_application)` - Autogenerate a job application, company, and user that will not get validated with ActiveRecord

Serializer: This serializer formats both the InterviewQuestion model instances (when fetching from database) and raw question strings (when newly generated from OpenAI). The map.with_index(1) starts indexing at 1 instead of 0, making the question numbers more human-readable (Question 1, 2, 3... instead of 0, 1, 2...).

```
{
  id: response_id,
  data: questions.map.with_index(1) do |question, index|
    {
      index: index, 
      type: "interview_question",
      attributes: {
        question: question.respond_to?(:question) ? question.question : question
      }
    }
  end

- ### **_Important Schema Note_**

  - This branch introduces 2 new tables to our db schema - **roles** and **users_roles** that were generated by Rolify:

    - **roles** table has name, resouce_type and resource_id. Name string is the name of the role and can either be ["admin"] OR ["user"]. Resource type string is an optional polymorphic association that specifies the type of resource the role applies to (company, job, contact).
      - Whenever a user is created, they are automatically assigned a role[:name] of `["user"]`
    - **users_roles** is a join table for the many-to-many relationship between users and roles.

- ## Understanding [JWT(Json Web Token) Gem](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt/blob/main/README.md)

  We now use JSON Web Tokens for user authentication. Here's what to know:

  - ### Key Concepts
    - **Token-Based Authentication**
      - Upon login, a JWT is issued to the registered user.
      - The token must be included in the **Headers** for every authenticated request in Postman.
        - Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
      - The token encodes a **payload** that contains:
        - User's id
        - User's role (either "admin" or "user")
        - Tokens expiration time (24 hours after issue)
    - **Changes made in Codebase**
      - **ApplicationController** now has 2 new methods:
        - `authenticate_user` ensures tokens validity and corresponds to a logged-in user.
        - `decoded_token(token)` to extract info from token
        - All controllers will inherit this logic.
      - **SessionsController**
        - Handles login and session creation
        - `#create` action:
          - Verifies user's credentials
          - `generate_token(payload)` generates an encoded JWT using above-mentioned **payload**
          - Sends the token back in the response

- ## Understanding the [Rolify Gem](https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify/blob/master/README.md)

  Rolify simplifies the management of user roles by introducing a flexible, role-based system. This gem created the **roles** and **users_roles** tables.

  - ### Key Concepts

    - When a new user is created, they are automatically assigned the user role.
    - Methods in **user.rb** created as querying and setting shortcuts:
      - `assign_default_role` is called to set a user's role to `:user` upon a new instance of User being created. All new users will get role :user.
      - `is_admin?` and/or `is_user?` queries any user's role
      - `set_role(role_name)` assigns a specific role to a user(e.g `user1.set_role(:admin)` will set a user to the :admin role)
    - For future scalability, polymorphic roles can be scoped to specific users. For example, we can add in a :moderator role in the future that would be an :admin for only the company table. Enabled by resource_type and resource_id fields in **roles** table.

  - ### Usage in Codebase

    - In your models where roles are needed (e.g., User, Company), use: `resourcify` at the top of the class(near validations/relations) to make the model "role-aware" and capable of interacting with Rolify
    - Use above-mentioned methods in **user.rb** to query and set user roles.

  - ### How this affected the Codebase
    - **UsersController** now leverages roles to restrict access. For example, only an :admin can view all users (subject to change, ofc)
    - **ApplicationPolicy** Includes logic to ensure actions are authorized based on roles.
    - Affects RSpec testing to test role-based permitted controller actions (see **index_spec.rb** ln:7 for an example)

- ## Understanding the [Pundit Gem](https://github.com/varvet/pundit/blob/main/README.md)

      Pundit enforces authorization through policy classes and ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions. To fully understand Pundit, you must understand what a policy is:
      - A policy is a PORO that defines the rules governing what actions a user is authorized to perform on a resource (e.g., User, Job, Company). Each policy corresponds to a model's controller and centralizes the access control logic for that resource.
      - I have set up **UserPolicy** for it's corresponding **UsersController** as a template for all to use. **UserPolicy** restricts which CRUD actions a user can use depending on that user's role. All of **Users** associated request spec files have also been refactored to pass and are a template for you.

      - ### Key Concepts
          - **Policy Classes** as mentioned above define an action a user can take
              - stored in app/policies and inherit from **ApplicationPolicy**
              - Policies are then passed to **ApplicationController** via `  include Pundit::Authorization` ln:2. Remember that all controllers inherit from **ApplicationController** unless explicitly told not to.
          - **Authorization Logic**
              - Authorization is defined in methods corresponding to controller actions (e.g., **create?**, **update?**).
              - **ApplicationPolicy** provides a default template where ALL actions are unauthorized by default.
              - Use **UserPolicy** (and it's associated spec file for testing) as a template for making your controller's policies.
          - **Scoping**
              - Policies include a nested **Scope** class (see **UserPolicy**) to define which records a user can access when retrieving a collection.
      - ### Usage in Codebase
          - Use the `authorize` method IN your controller action code blocks to enforce policy checks (see **UsersController** ln: 5, 15, 21, 28 for examples. Yes, it is THAT easy :))
          - If a user is unauthorized, Pundit raises a `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError` in your console RSpec testing suite.
          - For testing, refer to **user_policy_spec.rb** as a template. Note that ln:3 `subject { described_class }` subject == **UserPolicy**
          - Policies integrate with Rolify to check user roles

      ## In conclusion
          - JWT secures the app by ensuring only authenticated users can access resources.
          - Rolify manages who can act (roles), while Pundit manages what they can do (authorization).
          - Refactoring controllers and policies is critical to aligning with this new system.
          - Ensure all tests are updated to reflect these changes, including controller specs and new policy tests.
          - It is up to you, as you develop to keep in mind what actions users are authorized to take.  :Admin role users should be authorized to do anything.
